# Project Blitzkarte
Blitzkarte means "Lightning Map" in German, and it is a program which automates a gloabl variation of the social game Diplomacy.
Players control a country as they cooperate and compete to be among the 3 winners.
It is a turn based game where players submit orders for their countries in secret, and then simultaneous processed and announced, revealing everyone's true colors.

## Implementation
The glory of React is leveraged to dynamically render a variety of complex operations.
The game state is displayed as a map through the harmony of React, SVGs and navigated through Greensock.
React renders the possible orders for the player, which is properly permissioned while leveraging firebase.
ReactQuery is excellent at managing states and renders throughout the request lifecycle.
We have site navigation powered by Next and various flair is accented by Material UI.
